# Meal Times

## Who is this for?

Restaurants and food services such as convenience stores and grocery stores.

## What is our goal?

Make a marketplace for food delivery services to make it easier for small business owners to sell their merchandise online and for clients to easily access it.

## Features

All users (registered and visitors) have visitor features but visitors do not have access to user features (registration required).
Both buyers and sellers have access to user features (user features are the shared features between these two entities).

## Features for a visitor (not a registered user)

- View application catalog (different stores registered)
- View product catalog (the products of a specific store)
- Search the application for different stores
- Search a store catalog for different products

## Features for users (sellers and buyers - registered)

- Register
- Login
- Logout
- 2FA
- Access their own records (profile, orders)

## Features for sellers

- Manage products (add, delete, modify)
- Create and modify their store profile
- Retrieve customer information
- Manage customer orders (confirm, process transaction, close, retrieve)
- Search customer database
- Update order status (confirmed, in progress, ready for pickup)
- Able to cancel orders if payment does not go through

## Features for buyers/clients

- Manage cart (add, delete, modify)
- Modify information (registration, name, address, phone number, billing)
- Add services to a "preferred" section -> able to like services and keep them in a more easily accessible tab
- See product details
- Track order status (view confirmed, in progress and ready for pickup)
- Able to cancel order before its status is "in progress"

## Total Features

This application will comprise a total of 25 new features (not including the required ones such as registration, login, logout and 2FA).

## Allocated Time

We estimate that we will spend a total of 130hrs building this project. This is merely an estimation and is subject to change.

## Influences & Inspirations

Inspired by common food delivery services such as UberEats, DoorDash and common marketplaces such as Walmart, Etsy and Amazon.
