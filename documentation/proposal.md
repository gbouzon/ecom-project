# Meal Times

## Who is this for?

Restaurants and food services such as convenience stores and grocery stores.

## What is our goal?

Make a marketplace for food delivery services to make it easier for small business owners to sell their merchandise online and for clients to easily access it.

## Some General Features

All users should be able to register, login, logout, have access to their own order records and view catalogs for the different stores.

## Features for sellers

- Manage products (add, delete, modify)
- Create and modify their store profile
- Retrieve customer information
- Manage customer orders (confirm, process transaction, close, retrieve)
- Search customer database
- Search product catalog
- Update order status (confirmed, in progress, ready for pickup)

## Features for buyers/clients

- Manage cart (add, delete, modify)
- Modify information (registration, name, address, phone number, billing)
- Add services to a "preferred" section -> able to like services and keep them in a more easily accessible tab
- Search the application for different stores
- Search for products of a specific store
- See product details
- Track order status (view confirmed, in progress and ready for pickup)
- Able to cancel order before its status is "in progress"

## Total Features

This application will comprise a total of 24 new features (not including the required ones such as registration, login, logout and 2FA).

## Allocated Time

We estimate that we will spend a total of 130hrs building this project. This is merely an estimation and is subject to change.

## Influences & Inspirations

Inspired by common food delivery services such as UberEats, DoorDash and common marketplaces such as Walmart, Etsy and Amazon.
