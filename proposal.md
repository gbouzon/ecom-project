# Meal Times

## Who is this for?

Restaurants and food services such as convenience stores and grocery stores.

## What is our goal?

Make a marketplace for food delivery services to make it easier for small business owners to sell their merchandise online and for clients to easily access it.

## Some General Features

All users should be able to register, login, logout, have access to their own order records and view catalogs for the different stores.

## Features for sellers

- Manage products (add, delete, modify)
- Create and modify their store profile
- Retrieve customer information
- Manage customer orders (confirm, close, retrieve)
- **Process transactions**[^1]
- Search customer database
- Search product catalog
- **Manage deliveries** [^2]
[^1]: It seems like this should happen in the order confirmation unless you care to explain
[^2]: Are you adding requests, confirming pickups, and confirming delivery of orders?

## Features for buyers/clients

- Manage cart (add, delete, modify)
- Modify information (registration, name, address, phone number, billing)
- Add services to a "preferred" section -> able to like services and keep them in a more easily accessible tab
- Search the application for different stores as well as the catalog for a specific store
- See product details
- **Search for products** [^3]
- Track deliveries
[^3]: Repetition of part of the point 2 bullets above? 

## Total Features

This application will comprise a total of 24 new features (not including the required ones such as registration, login, logout and 2FA).

## Allocated Time

We estimate that we will spend a total of 130hrs building this project. This is merely an estimation and is subject to change.

## Influences & Inspirations

Inspired by common food delivery services such as UberEats, DoorDash and common marketplaces such as Walmart, Etsy and Amazon.
